##Learn Vim - Module 1: (Not just an) Intro

[http://www.vim.org/](Vim) is a command-line text editor, created by [http://www.moolenaar.net/](Bram Moolenar).
It stands for 'Vi-IMproved'; 'Vi' was an older ubiquitous editor, which was enhanced to create Vim.

To open Vim, just type `vim` at the command-prompt.
Note that on most modern systems, `vi` is symlinked to `vim`.
However, just in case the symlink does not exist, I recommend typing the whole word `vim`.
