Welcome to the most unique tutorial on Vim -- the best text-editor on the planet!

### Features
- Very comprehensive
- Useful for novices and professionals alike
- No screenshots! You are supposed to follow the tutorial with Vim open alongside
- Feel of someone sitting by your side and teaching you

### Modules
We will learn Vim over six modules:

1. [(Not just an) Intro](./module1)
2. [BTW (Buffers, Tabs, Windows)](./module2)
3. [Being Normal](./module3)
4. [Coderz](./module4)
5. [Plug n Play](./module5)
6. [That's not all, Folks!](./module6)

The first three modules will be concerned with vanilla (read 'pure') Vim.
The fourth module will introduce some external tools and tips for coding in Vim.
The fifth module will touch upon some popular useful plugins.
The sixth module will give an insight into some advanced concepts, and tell you how to learn more.

By the end, you will be able to proudly call yourself a _Vim expert_.
So let's get started with [(Not just an) Intro](module-1).
